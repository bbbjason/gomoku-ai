Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (3 bits)
 - output out (2 bits)

The module should implement a "population count" circuit that counts the
number of '1's in the input vector.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [2:0] in,
  output [1:0] out
);

  assign out = in[0]+in[1]+in[2];

endmodule
[DONE]
