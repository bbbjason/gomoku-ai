Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in    (8 bits)
 - output pedge (8 bits)

The module should examine each bit in an 8-bit vector and detect when the
input signal changes from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to
positive edge detection). The output bit should be set the cycle after a
0 to 1 transition occurs.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] pedge
);

  reg [7:0] d_last;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    d_last <= in;
    pedge <= in & ~d_last;
  end

endmodule
[DONE]
