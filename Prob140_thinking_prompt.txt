Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output disc
 - output flag
 - output err

Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of
data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of
frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a
"flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from
accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5
consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need
to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a
Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

  (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
  (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
  (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the
previous input were 0. The reset signal is active-high asynchronous. The
output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the
clock cycle after the condition occurs. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Additional requirement: use asynchronous reset behavior in all sequential logic.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob140 example1:

1) Parse the modified prompt constraints for example1.
2) Identify interface, reset behavior, and required output timing.
3) Derive minimal FSM/datapath structure that satisfies the modified logic.
4) Ensure edge/corner conditions in the example prompt are handled.
5) Keep Verilog style consistent with project constraints.
6) Validate with provided testbench flow (iverilog + vvp).

Note:
- This is concise guidance text for downstream small-model solving.
- If prompt logic differs from base testbench assumptions, adjust testbench accordingly.

Timing change: any completion pulse/output that was delayed by 1 cycle must now be asserted in the same cycle as the triggering event.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob140:

1) Read the interface and identify required I/O behavior.
2) Decide FSM/datapath split if the problem is stateful.
3) Define minimal states and transitions from the spec examples.
4) Implement sequential logic with synchronous reset semantics from prompt.
5) Implement outputs so timing matches the prompt/testbench expectations.
6) Verify against provided testbench and check corner cases.

- This is concise reasoning guidance for small-model solving.
- Keep implementation style compatible with the dataset constraints.
