Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a shift register with four D flops. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
Reset is active-low synchronous resettable.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input resetn,
  input in,
  output out
);

  reg [3:0] sr;
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (~resetn)
      sr <= '0;
    else
      sr <= {sr[2:0], in};
  end

  assign out = sr[3];

endmodule
[DONE]
