Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  d (8 bits)
 - output q (8 bits)

Implement a module that includes 8 D flip-flops with active high
synchronous reset. The flip-flops must be reset to 0x34 rather than zero.
All DFFs should be triggered by the negative edge of clk.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  input reset,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  always @(negedge clk)
    if (reset)
      q <= 8'h34;
    else
      q <= d;

endmodule
[DONE]
