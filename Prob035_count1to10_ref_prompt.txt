Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (4 bits)

The module should implement a decade counter that counts 1 through 10,
inclusive. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge
of the clock. The reset input is active high synchronous, and should
reset the counter to 1.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output reg [3:0] q
);

  always @(posedge clk)
    if (reset || q == 10)
      q <= 1;
    else
      q <= q+1;

endmodule
[DONE]
