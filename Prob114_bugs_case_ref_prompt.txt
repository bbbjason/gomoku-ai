Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  code (8 bits)
 - output out  (4 bits)
 - output valid

The module should recognize 8-bit keyboard scancodes for keys 0 through
9. It should indicate whether one of the 10 cases were recognized
(valid), and if so, which key was detected. If the 8-bit input is 8'h45,
8'h16, 8'h1e, 8'h26, 8'h25, 8'h2e, 8'h36, 8'h3d, 8'h3e, or 8'h46, the
4-bit output will be set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively,
the 1-bit valid would be set to 1. If the input does not match any of the
cases, both output signals would be set to 0.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] code,
  output reg [3:0] out,
  output reg valid
);

  // uhh.. make a case statement: maps scancode to 0-9, but accidentally
  // infer a latch? and have one of the entries be wrong? (duplicate
  // case, using different base!)

  always @(*) begin
    out = 0;
    valid = 1;
    case (code)
      8'h45: out = 0;
      8'h16: out = 1;
      8'h1e: out = 2;
      8'h26: out = 3;
      8'h25: out = 4;
      8'h2e: out = 5;
      8'h36: out = 6;
      8'h3d: out = 7;
      8'h3e: out = 8;
      8'h46: out = 9;
      default: valid = 0;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[DONE]
