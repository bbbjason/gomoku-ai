Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  x   (4 bits)
 - input  y   (4 bits)
 - output sum (5 bits)

Implement a 4-bit adder with full adders. The output sum should include
the overflow bit.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] x,
  input [3:0] y,
  output [4:0] sum
);

  assign sum = x+y;

endmodule
[DONE]
