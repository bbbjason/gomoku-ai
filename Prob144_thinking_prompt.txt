Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  load
 - input  data (256 bits)
 - output q (256 bits)

The module should implemement a "game" played on a two-dimensional grid
of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time
step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:

  (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.
  (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.
  (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.
  (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.

The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use
a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16
toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For
example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15),
(0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by
a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a
sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc.

  (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial
       state. active-high asynchronous.
  (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.

The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Additional requirement: use asynchronous reset behavior in all sequential logic.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob144 example1:

1) Parse the modified prompt constraints for example1.
2) Identify interface, reset behavior, and required output timing.
3) Derive minimal FSM/datapath structure that satisfies the modified logic.
4) Ensure edge/corner conditions in the example prompt are handled.
5) Keep Verilog style consistent with project constraints.
6) Validate with provided testbench flow (iverilog + vvp).

Note:
- This is concise guidance text for downstream small-model solving.
- If prompt logic differs from base testbench assumptions, adjust testbench accordingly.

Timing change: any completion pulse/output that was delayed by 1 cycle must now be asserted in the same cycle as the triggering event.

Question:
<<<add problem here>>>

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob144:

1) Read the interface and identify required I/O behavior.
2) Decide FSM/datapath split if the problem is stateful.
3) Define minimal states and transitions from the spec examples.
4) Implement sequential logic with synchronous reset semantics from prompt.
5) Implement outputs so timing matches the prompt/testbench expectations.
6) Verify against provided testbench and check corner cases.

Note:
- This is concise reasoning guidance for small-model solving.
- Keep implementation style compatible with the dataset constraints.
