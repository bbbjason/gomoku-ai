Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input clk
 - input d
 - input q

The module should implement a single D flip-flop. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  initial
    q = 1'hx;

  always @(posedge clk)
    q <= d;

endmodule
[DONE]
