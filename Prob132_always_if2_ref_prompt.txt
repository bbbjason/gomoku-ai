Question:
Consider the following adder-subtractor with a zero flag:

  module TopModule (
      input      cpu_overheated,
      output reg shut_off_computer,
      input      arrived,
      input      gas_tank_empty,
      output reg keep_driving
  );

      always @(*) begin
          if (cpu_overheated)
             shut_off_computer = 1;
      end

      always @(*) begin
          if (~arrived)
             keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
      end

  endmodule

Unfortunately, this module has a bug. Implement a new version of this
module that fixes the bug.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input cpu_overheated,
  output reg shut_off_computer,
  input arrived,
  input gas_tank_empty,
  output reg keep_driving
);

  always @(*) begin
    if (cpu_overheated)
      shut_off_computer = 1;
    else
      shut_off_computer = 0;
  end

  always @(*) begin
    if (~arrived)
      keep_driving = !gas_tank_empty;
    else
      keep_driving = 1'b0;
  end

endmodule
[DONE]
