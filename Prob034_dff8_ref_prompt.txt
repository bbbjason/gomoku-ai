Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  d   (8 bits)
 - output q   (8 bits)

The module should include 8 D flip-flops. All DFFs should be triggered by
the positive edge of clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  output reg [7:0] q
);

  initial
    q = 8'h0;

  always @(posedge clk)
    q <= d;

endmodule
[DONE]
