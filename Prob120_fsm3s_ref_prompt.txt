Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a Moore state machine with the following
state transition table with one input, one output, and four states.
Include a synchronous active high reset that resets the FSM to state A.
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

  State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
  A     | A, B                             | 0
  B     | C, B                             | 0
  C     | A, D                             | 0
  D     | C, B                             | 1

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input in,
  input reset,
  output out
);

  parameter A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3;
  reg [1:0] state;
  reg [1:0] next;

  always_comb begin
    case (state)
      A: next = in ? B : A;
      B: next = in ? B : C;
      C: next = in ? D : A;
      D: next = in ? B : C;
    endcase
  end

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) state <= A;
      else state <= next;
  end

  assign out = (state==D);

endmodule
[DONE]
