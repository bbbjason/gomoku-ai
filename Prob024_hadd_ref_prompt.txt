Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output sum
 - output cout

The module should implement a half adder. A half adder adds two bits
(with no carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input a,
  input b,
  output sum,
  output cout
);

  assign {cout, sum} = a+b;

endmodule
[DONE]
