Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  x
 - input  y
 - output f
 - output g

Consider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of
motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and
produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock
input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called
resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is
asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the
reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has
to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to
monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three
successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock
cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y
has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should
maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not
become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0
permanently (until reset). Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.

Additional requirement: add one optional enable input (en). State/data update only when en=1.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob139 example1:

1) Parse the modified prompt constraints for example1.
2) Identify interface, reset behavior, and required output timing.
3) Derive minimal FSM/datapath structure that satisfies the modified logic.
4) Ensure edge/corner conditions in the example prompt are handled.
5) Keep Verilog style consistent with project constraints.
6) Validate with provided testbench flow (iverilog + vvp).

Note:
- This is concise guidance text for downstream small-model solving.
- If prompt logic differs from base testbench assumptions, adjust testbench accordingly.

Timing change: any completion pulse/output that was delayed by 1 cycle must now be asserted in the same cycle as the triggering event.

Question:
<<<add problem here>>>

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob139:

1) Read the interface and identify required I/O behavior.
2) Decide FSM/datapath split if the problem is stateful.
3) Define minimal states and transitions from the spec examples.
4) Implement sequential logic with synchronous reset semantics from prompt.
5) Implement outputs so timing matches the prompt/testbench expectations.
6) Verify against provided testbench and check corner cases.

Note:
- This is concise reasoning guidance for small-model solving.
- Keep implementation style compatible with the dataset constraints.
