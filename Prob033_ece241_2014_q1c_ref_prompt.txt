Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a (8 bits)
 - input  b (8 bits)
 - output s (8 bits)
 - output overflow

Assume that you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0].
The module should add these numbers to produce s[7:0]. Also compute
whether a (signed) overflow has occurred.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output [7:0] s,
  output overflow
);

  wire [8:0] sum = a+b;
  assign s = sum[7:0];
  assign overflow = !(a[7]^b[7]) && (a[7] != s[7]);

endmodule
[DONE]
