Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in
 - input  state (10 bits)
 - output next_state (10 bits)
 - output out1
 - output out2

Given the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs
are given as "(out1, out2)"):

  S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1
  S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2
  S2 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S2 (0, 0) --1--> S3
  S3 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4
  S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0
  S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5
  S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8
  S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6
  S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9
  S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7
  S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0
  S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7
  S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0
  S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1
  S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0
  S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1

Suppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through
state[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs
are zero unless otherwise specified. The next_state[0] through next_state[9] 
correspond to the transition to next states S0 though S9. For example, The 
next_state[1] is set to 1 when the next state is S1 , otherwise, it is set to 0.

Here, the input state[9:0] can be a combinational of multiple states, and 
the TopModule is expected to response.
For example: 
When the state[9:0] = 10'b0000010100, state[4] == 1, and state[2] == 1, the 
states includes S4, and S2 states.

The module should implement the state transition logic and output logic
portions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are
given the current state in state[9:0] and must implement next_state[9:0] 
and the two outputs.

Additional requirement: add one optional enable input (en). State/data update only when en=1.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob143 example1:

1) Parse the modified prompt constraints for example1.
2) Identify interface, reset behavior, and required output timing.
3) Derive minimal FSM/datapath structure that satisfies the modified logic.
4) Ensure edge/corner conditions in the example prompt are handled.
5) Keep Verilog style consistent with project constraints.
6) Validate with provided testbench flow (iverilog + vvp).

Note:
- This is concise guidance text for downstream small-model solving.
- If prompt logic differs from base testbench assumptions, adjust testbench accordingly.

Timing change: any completion pulse/output that was delayed by 1 cycle must now be asserted in the same cycle as the triggering event.

Logic change: replace the original trigger/header condition with a two-bit pattern match (in[7] & ~in[6]).

Question:
<<<add problem here>>>

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob143:

1) Read the interface and identify required I/O behavior.
2) Decide FSM/datapath split if the problem is stateful.
3) Define minimal states and transitions from the spec examples.
4) Implement sequential logic with synchronous reset semantics from prompt.
5) Implement outputs so timing matches the prompt/testbench expectations.
6) Verify against provided testbench and check corner cases.

Note:
- This is concise reasoning guidance for small-model solving.
- Keep implementation style compatible with the dataset constraints.
