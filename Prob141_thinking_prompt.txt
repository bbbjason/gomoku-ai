Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  ena
 - output pm
 - output hh (8 bits)
 - output mm (8 bits)
 - output ss (8 bits)

Create a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm
indicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse
on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second, while
"clk" is much faster than once per second). The signal "pm" is asserted
if the clock is PM, or is otherwise AM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD
(Binary- Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59),
and seconds (00-59). Reset is the active-high asynchronous signal that
resets the clock to "12:00 AM." Reset has higher priority than enable and
can occur even when not enabled. Assume all sequential logic is triggered
on the positive edge of the clock.

Additional requirement: use asynchronous reset behavior in all sequential logic.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob141 example1:

1) Parse the modified prompt constraints for example1.
2) Identify interface, reset behavior, and required output timing.
3) Derive minimal FSM/datapath structure that satisfies the modified logic.
4) Ensure edge/corner conditions in the example prompt are handled.
5) Keep Verilog style consistent with project constraints.
6) Validate with provided testbench flow (iverilog + vvp).

Note:
- This is concise guidance text for downstream small-model solving.
- If prompt logic differs from base testbench assumptions, adjust testbench accordingly.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
input clk,
  input reset,
  input ena,
  output reg pm,
  output reg [7:0] hh,
  output reg [7:0] mm,
  output reg [7:0] ss

  // example1 variant
  always @(*) begin
    pm = ena;

Timing change: any completion pulse/output that was delayed by 1 cycle must now be asserted in the same cycle as the triggering event.

Question:
<<<add problem here>>>

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob141:

1) Read the interface and identify required I/O behavior.
2) Decide FSM/datapath split if the problem is stateful.
3) Define minimal states and transitions from the spec examples.
4) Implement sequential logic with synchronous reset semantics from prompt.
5) Implement outputs so timing matches the prompt/testbench expectations.
6) Verify against provided testbench and check corner cases.

Note:
- This is concise reasoning guidance for small-model solving.
- Keep implementation style compatible with the dataset constraints.
