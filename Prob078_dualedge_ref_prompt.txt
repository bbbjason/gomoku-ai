Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  d
 - output q

A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock.
However, FPGAs don't have dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and using an
always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) is not accepted as a legal
sensitivity list. Build a circuit that functionally behaves like a
dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input d,
  output reg q
);

  /*always @(posedge clk, negedge clk) begin
    q <= d;
  end*/

  reg qp, qn;
  always @(posedge clk)
    qp <= d;
  always @(negedge clk)
    qn <= d;

  // This causes q to change too early when clk changes. Need delay by
  // delta cycle
  // assign q = clk ? qp : qn;
  always @(*)
    q <= clk ? qp : qn;

endmodule
[DONE]
