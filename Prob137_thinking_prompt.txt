Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output done

In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent
along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes
from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8
data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing
is being transmitted (idle).

Implement a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been
correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the
start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was
correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait
until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
Include a active-high asynchronous reset. Note that the serial protocol
sends the least significant bit first.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Additional requirement: use asynchronous reset behavior in all sequential logic.

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob137 example1:

1) Parse the modified prompt constraints for example1.
2) Identify interface, reset behavior, and required output timing.
3) Derive minimal FSM/datapath structure that satisfies the modified logic.
4) Ensure edge/corner conditions in the example prompt are handled.
5) Keep Verilog style consistent with project constraints.
6) Validate with provided testbench flow (iverilog + vvp).

Note:
- This is concise guidance text for downstream small-model solving.
- If prompt logic differs from base testbench assumptions, adjust testbench accordingly.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
input clk,
  input in,
  input reset,
  output done
);

  // example1 variant
  assign done = in;

Timing change: any completion pulse/output that was delayed by 1 cycle must now be asserted in the same cycle as the triggering event.

Logic change: replace the original trigger/header condition with a two-bit pattern match (in[7] & ~in[6]).

Corner-case requirement: if a new start/trigger condition appears while an operation/packet is in progress, immediately abandon the partial result and restart from the new start point (resynchronization behavior).

Think:
High-level solution outline for Prob137:

1) Read the interface and identify required I/O behavior.
2) Decide FSM/datapath split if the problem is stateful.
3) Define minimal states and transitions from the spec examples.
4) Implement sequential logic with synchronous reset semantics from prompt.
5) Implement outputs so timing matches the prompt/testbench expectations.
6) Verify against provided testbench and check corner cases.

- This is concise reasoning guidance for small-model solving.
- Keep implementation style compatible with the dataset constraints.
