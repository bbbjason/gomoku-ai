Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in    (32 bits)
 - output out   (32 bits)

The module should examine each bit in the 32-bit input vector, and
capture when the input signal changes from 1 in one clock cycle to 0 the
next. "Capture" means that the output will remain 1 until the register is
reset (active high synchronous reset). Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input [31:0] in,
  output reg [31:0] out
);

  reg [31:0] d_last;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    d_last <= in;
    if (reset)
      out <= '0;
    else
      out <= out | (~in & d_last);
  end

endmodule
[DONE]
