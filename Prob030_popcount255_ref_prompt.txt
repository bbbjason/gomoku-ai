Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (255 bits)
 - output out (  8 bits)

A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input
vector. The module should implement a population count circuit for a
255-bit input vector.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [254:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

  always_comb  begin
    out = 0;
    for (int i=0;i<255;i++)
      out = out + in[i];
  end

endmodule
[DONE]
