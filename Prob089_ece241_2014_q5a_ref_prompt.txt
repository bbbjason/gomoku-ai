Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  x
 - output z

The module should implement a one-input one-output serial 2's
complementer Moore state machine. The input (x) is a series of bits (one
per clock cycle) beginning with the least-significant bit of the number,
and the output (Z) is the 2's complement of the input. The machine will
accept input numbers of arbitrary length. The circuit requires a positive
edge triggered asynchronous reset. The conversion begins when Reset is
released and stops when Reset is asserted. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input areset,
  input x,
  output z
);

  parameter A=0,B=1,C=2;
  reg [1:0] state;
  always @(posedge clk, posedge areset) begin
    if (areset)
      state <= A;
    else begin
      case (state)
        A: state <= x ? C : A;
        B: state <= x ? B : C;
        C: state <= x ? B : C;
      endcase
    end
  end

  assign z = (state == C);

endmodule
[DONE]
