Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (32 bits)
 - output out (32 bits)

The module should reverse the byte order of a 32-bit vector.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [31:0] in,
  output [31:0] out
);

  assign out = {in[7:0], in[15:8], in[23:16], in[31:24]};

endmodule
[DONE]
