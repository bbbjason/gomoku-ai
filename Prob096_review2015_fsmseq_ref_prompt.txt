Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  data
 - output start_shifting

The module should implement a finite-state machine that searches for the
sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it
should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Reset is active
high synchronous. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input data,
  output start_shifting
);

  parameter S=0, S1=1, S11=2, S110=3, Done=4;

  reg [2:0] state, next;

  always_comb begin
    case (state)
      S: next = data ? S1: S;
      S1: next = data ? S11: S;
      S11: next = data ? S11 : S110;
      S110: next = data ? Done : S;
      Done: next = Done;
    endcase
  end

  always @(posedge clk)
    if (reset) state <= S;
    else state <= next;

  assign start_shifting = state == Done;

endmodule
[DONE]
