Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  aresetn
 - input  x
 - output z

The module should implement a Mealy-type finite state machine that
recognizes the sequence "101" on an input signal named x. Your FSM should
have an output signal, z, that is asserted to logic-1 when the "101"
sequence is detected. Your FSM should also have a negative edge triggered
asynchronous reset. You may only have 3 states in your state machine.
Your FSM should recognize overlapping sequences. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input aresetn,
  input x,
  output reg z
);

  parameter S=0, S1=1, S10=2;
  reg[1:0] state, next;

  always@(posedge clk, negedge aresetn)
    if (!aresetn)
      state <= S;
    else
      state <= next;

  always_comb begin
    case (state)
      S: next = x ? S1 : S;
      S1: next = x ? S1 : S10;
      S10: next = x ? S1 : S;
      default: next = 'x;
    endcase
  end

  always_comb begin
    case (state)
      S: z = 0;
      S1: z = 0;
      S10: z = x;
      default: z = 'x;
    endcase
  end

endmodule
[DONE]
