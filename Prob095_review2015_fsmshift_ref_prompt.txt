Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output shift_ena

This module is a part of the FSM for controlling a shift register, we
want the ability to enable the shift register for exactly 4 clock cycles
whenever the proper bit pattern is detected. Whenever the FSM is reset,
assert shift_ena for 4 cycles, then 0 forever (until reset). Reset should
be active high synchronous.

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input reset,
  output shift_ena
);

  parameter B0=0, B1=1, B2=2, B3=3, Done=4;

  reg [2:0] state, next;

  always_comb begin
    case (state)
      B0: next = B1;
      B1: next = B2;
      B2: next = B3;
      B3: next = Done;
      Done: next = Done;
    endcase
  end

  always @(posedge clk)
    if (reset) state <= B0;
    else state <= next;

  assign shift_ena = (state == B0 || state == B1 || state == B2 || state == B3);

endmodule
[DONE]
