Question:
I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (100 bits)
 - output out (100 bits)

The module should reverse the bit ordering of the input and write to the
output.

Answer:
[BEGIN]
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output reg [99:0] out
);

  always_comb
    for (int i=0;i<$bits(out);i++)
      out[i] = in[$bits(out)-i-1];

endmodule
[DONE]
